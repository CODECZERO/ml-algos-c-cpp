# ML from Scratch in C & C++

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **Machine Learning algorithms** written entirely from scratch in **C and C++** â€” without using external ML libraries.  
The goal is to understand how ML works under the hood by building everything step by step.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Features
- Implementations in both **C** and **C++**
- No external ML frameworks (pure logic)
- Well-structured, modular, and beginner-friendly
- Focus on performance and clarity
- Learning resource for students and developers
